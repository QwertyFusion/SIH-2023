**Team Name:** Brainstorm Brewers  
**Team Leader Name:** Rishi Banerjee  
**Institute Name:** KIIT University

## Idea/Solution
We seek a solution for an application that offers personalized health guidance, bridging the gap between physical and mental health, catering to diverse health needs. Key features of the project include overall health assessment, personalized recommendation on health, mental health support, appointment scheduling with the nearest doctor. UI/UX Design, Dashboard for health tracking and assessments. Using databases to store user's profile data and information on nearby doctors, hospitals, medicine shops, ambulances, etc. Emergency supplies (Oxygen, Blood Sample, etc.) availability in shops will be shown. Integrate APIs from wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit) for health data. Integrate a Content Management System (CMS) for health education resources. Implement chatbot integration using AI/ML (using NLP capabilities tools). Comply with the relevant regional laws (for eg HIPAA). Develop gamification features like challenges, rewards, and badges to motivate users.
